# Thyroid-disease-prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting endocrine diseases using machine learning models. The dataset consists of 3772 patients, and compare the performance of three machine learning algorithms combined with three different over-sampling techniques to improve classification accuracy.

## Models and Techniques
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:**
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest (RF)
  - Logistic Regression (LR)
  
- **Over-Sampling Methods:**
  - Random OverSampling
  - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
  - ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)

## Dataset
- Contains data from **3772 patients**.
  
## Goal
To identify which combination of ML algorithms and over-sampling techniques is most effective for predicting endocrine diseases.
